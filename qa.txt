This automatic draft stores all the details you have entered so far.<br/><br/>After this point, the draft becomes visible in the “List of Proposals” section.<br/>👉 <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;color:#1155cc;"><a href="https://devirmnp.indianrailways.gov.in/list_of_proposal/#cof" target="_blank">https://devirmnp.indianrailways.gov.in/list_of_proposal/#cof</a></span> <br/>You can open it anytime, continue entering information, and resume the proposal from where you left off.<br/><br/>In addition to the automatic draft, there is also a “Save Draft” button available on the form.

MNP and RSP Workflow & Proposal Management	What is the difference between "Save Draft," "Finalize," and "Initiate?	Save Draft:<br/>Use Save Draft when you want to store the information you have entered so far without submitting it for any checks or processing. This option simply saves your work-in-progress so you can return later and continue. At this stage, the proposal is visible only to you and does not enter any workflow.<br/><br/>Finalize:<br/>Select Finalize when all required details and documents have been entered correctly and the proposal is complete. The system will perform necessary validations and lock the proposal as a finalized version. Finalizing prepares the proposal for submission but does not start the approval process.<br/><br/>Initiate:<br/>Choose Initiate when you are ready for the proposal to move into the official approval workflow. This action forwards the proposal to the designated officers for review, vetting, and approval according to the workflow rules.<br/><br/>You will see all three buttons inside the proposal form.
MNP and RSP Workflow & Proposal Management	How do I know where my proposal is in the approval process?

Look at “Pending for action” <br/><br/>In the screenshot, we are on Pending for action (15).<br/>This means 15 files are waiting for your action, such as forward, approve, comment, or upload something.<br/><br/>🌟 3. Understand the table columns<br/>The table lists each file in a row and tells you:<br/><br/>Activity Name – What type of file it is (e.g., RSP Proposal)<br/>Railway/Type – Which railway/unit sent it<br/>File ID – Unique file number<br/>File Desc – Short description of the case<br/>Status – Current workflow stage (e.g., Ext. Forward)<br/>Sent By – Who forwarded the file to you<br/>Pending With – Who is supposed to act next<br/>Date – When it was received<br/>Document – PDF file attached<br/>File Movement – Shows full tracking history<br/>Action – Button to take action<br/>Info – Additional details<br/><br/>🌟 4. To check the full history (“Where is my file now?”)<br/><br/>Click the File Movement icon<br/>🔄 (the circular arrow pointed to in the screenshot).<br/><br/>This opens a detailed timeline showing:<br/>Who sent the file<br/>When it moved<br/>What action was taken<br/>Next person in the chain<br/>All remarks<br/>Complete audit trail<br/><br/>🌟 5. If you want to download or view documents<br/>Click the red PDF icon under the Document column.<br/><br/>🌟 6.

MNP and RSP Workflow & Proposal Management	How can I modify the proposal after initiation?

MNP and RSP Workflow & Proposal Management	What's the difference between "reject", "revert", and "revise"?	These three actions look similar, but they do very different things inside the workflow.<br/><br/>Let’s break them down simply:<br/><br/>❌ 1. Reject<br/>Reject means the proposal is completely declined.<br/>The workflow ends<br/>The proposal cannot move forward<br/>No further action happens unless a fresh proposal is created<br/>Used when the proposal is not acceptable at all (not fixable or not required)<br/>Reject = Final dismissal<br/><br/>🔄 2.

Revise<br/>Use Revise after the proposal is returned to you.<br/>This action reopens the proposal and allows editing of:<br/>Main details<br/>Cost<br/>Justification<br/>ROR<br/>Uploaded documents<br/>Any tab that needs correction<br/>After revising:<br/>Initiate again<br/>Revise = Edit the proposal after it returns to you<br/><br/>⭐ Summary Table<br/>Action	Who Uses It?	                                                What It Means	                                  What Happens?<br/>Reject	Approving officer	                                                Proposal is not accepted	                  Workflow ends completely<br/>Revert	Reviewing/Approving officer	                        Proposal needs correction	                  Sent back to previous user<br/>Revise	Proposal creator	                                                Edit/modify proposal after Revert	  Proposal becomes editable again<br/>🔑 In simple words<br/>Reject → Stop<br/>Revert → Send back<br/>Revise → Edit

Workflow & Approvals	What actions can I perform on a proposal that is pending my review?

Account & System	Why was I logged out of the system automatically?	The system logs you out automatically as a security measure. This happens mainly for session timeout and idle inactivity.<br/><br/>🌟 1. Session Timeout (Security Policy)<br/>The application uses session-based login.<br/>If you stay inactive for too long, your session expires automatically.<br/><br/>This prevents:<br/>Unauthorized access<br/>Accidental misuse if you forget to log out<br/>Others from using your account on a shared system<br/>(The session handling is managed in the backend authentication logic.)<br/><br/>🌟 2. Idle Inactivity<br/>If the system detects no activity—no clicks, no navigation, no data entry—it logs you out to protect your information.<br/><br/>🌟 3. Multiple Logins or Browser Close<br/>In some cases, if you:<br/>Log in from another browser<br/>Close the browser unexpectedly<br/>Lose your internet connection<br/>Your session may also be cleared for safety.<br/><br/>🌟 4. System Reset or Server Refresh<br/>If the admin resets sessions or the server refreshes, the system may log out all active users.<br/><br/>⭐ Summary<br/>You were automatically logged out because the system enforces session timeout and inactivity rules to protect your account.<br/>This is normal and part of the application’s security features.
Account & System	Does the system keep a log of my login activity?	Yes. The system automatically records every login and logout you perform.<br/>This is done through the built-in login history feature.<br/><br/>🌟 1. Login details are saved every time you sign in<br/>Whenever you log in, the system creates an entry in the login_history table containing:<br/><br/>Your username<br/>Session key<br/>Browser type<br/>Operating system<br/>IP address<br/>Login date & time<br/>Your user level<br/>This happens immediately during login using the login handler.<br/><br/>🌟 2. Logout is also recorded automatically<br/>When you click logout, the system updates your login record by adding the exact logout date & time.<br/>This ensures a complete session trail.<br/><br/>🌟 3. Session management is also tracked<br/>The system also stores your active session key in a session-tracking table.<br/>This prevents duplicate/multiple logins and improves security.<br/><br/>⭐ Summary<br/>Yes — the system keeps a full log of your activity:<br/>Every login<br/>Every logout<br/>Your browser, OS, IP,  session key<br/>Your user level during login<br/>All of this is stored securely to maintain accountability and user security.
